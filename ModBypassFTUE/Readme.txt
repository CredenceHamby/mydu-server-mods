# How to bypass NQ FTUE and make your own?

This mod changes the behavior of the game when a new player is created and
connects for the first time.

The payload and territory pickers are bypassed, player is given default
inventory and a blueprint, and spawned at market 6.


# Note:

Due to a glitch in 1.4.3 that does late mod initialization, this mod will only work
if at least one player connected *before* the new player connects.

This will be fixed in 1.4.4
