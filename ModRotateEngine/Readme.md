# Proof of concept of engine rotation

This is just a proof of concept and not realy useable as is.



## Usage

Right-click on the engines you want rotation control for and hit "Engine->set as rotating".

To rotate right click anywhere and select "Activate rotation control".

A new empty notification square appears on the bottom-right of the screen. Click on it and a tiny scrollbar will appear.

Click the scrollbar to rotate the engines on the construct you are parented to.
