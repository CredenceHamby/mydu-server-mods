# Teleporter config Mod

This mod exposes to all players popup menu entries to configure a limited
number of teleporters and their destination.

# Usage

On a teleporter, right click, select "mod teleporter" -> "set this TP target"
and pick one of the names.

On any element, right click, select "mod teleporter" -> "Make as target"
and pick the same.

# Note

The players will not interfere with each other since the names are prefixed
by player id in the code.
